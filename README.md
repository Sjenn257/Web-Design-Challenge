## Latitude vs. X

In this assignment, I took what I learned from HTML and CSS to create a dashboard showing off the WeatherPY analysis I did in a previous API assignment.

This site contains webpages with visualizations of the scatter plots relative to their latitude and distance from the equator.

What was the result? You'll have to visit the site to see!
